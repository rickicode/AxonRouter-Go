# Bug Scanner Journal

This file is both a record and the schedule for the Daily Bug Scanner autopilot.
Each entry is appended by the autopilot after a run.
The next run derives its side from the last `- Run side:` line.

## 2026-07-25 20:10 UTC
- Run side: routing
- Baseline: `go build ./...`
- Deep check: `go test -timeout 10m ./internal/api/... ./internal/connstate/... ./internal/proxypool/...`
- Result: scanner configured, first automated run pending
- Failures: none
- Issues created: none
- Notes: Initial journal created. Next side will be `executor`.

## 2026-07-25 20:42 UTC
- Run side: executor
- Baseline: `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin && go build ./...`
- Deep check: `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin && go test -timeout 10m ./internal/executor/... ./internal/translator/... ./internal/modalities/... ./internal/thinking/...`
- Objective result: found 1 failure
- Failure details:
  - `[baseline]` `go build ./...` → `HIJ-236` (`product`)
- Parity gap: Codex Responses WebSocket executor is present in CLIProxyAPI (`internal/runtime/executor/codex_websockets_executor.go`) but missing in AxonRouter-Go; already tracked in `HIJ-152`
- Issues created: `HIJ-236`
- Notes: Go binary was not on `PATH`; used `/usr/local/go/bin/go`. `web/build/` is gitignored and not present in a fresh checkout, so `go build ./...` fails until the frontend is built. After running `cd web && npm install && npm run build`, baseline passes. Deep check (executor/translator/modalities/thinking) passed.
